## TODO List

- Robot component
    - what data should it contain?
    - States? 


## Already Implemented
- tmx isometric tilemap rendering
- Camera pan/zoom and viewport culling
- Input handling (mouse/keyboard) for unit navigation (A* on tiles)
- Resource/asset from tmx file tileset (use tagging)
- ECS core with systems for pathfinding and movement
